0x02. AirBnB clone - MySQL

This repository consists of the initial phase of a student project to build a clone of the AirBnB website. The initial phase implements a backend interface, or console, to manage program data. Console commands enable the user to create, update, and destroy objects, in addition to managing file storage. Using a system of JSON serialization/deserialization, storage is persistent between sessions.
